# Previous Approach

Past approaches to answer this question relied on physiochemical features of molecules to use as features for building a model.

The DREAM model is one example. This model used a molecular descriptor package called Dragon. However, this apporached failed to answer the current problem because, due to symmetry, molecular decriptors will be identical between an enantiomeric pair.

For instance, the molecular weight, vapor pressure, and lipohilicites of the molecules in an enantiomeric pair will be the same because they (R) linalool and (S) linalool is still the same molecule from a molecular sense, they simply differ from a structural sense.
