# Detection Threshold

Divergence for each enantiomeric pair is derived from that pair's detection threshold[^1] ratio.

| Enantiomeric Pair         | Past Approach | New Approach |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| (R) carvone/(S) carvone   |       1       |     65       |
| (R) linalool/(S) linalool |       1       |     1.35     |

The old model couldn't detect a difference because divergence was determined by comparing molecular features which are identical within a pair. However divergence in the new model is captured by detection threshold ratio. Now we will see if structural features can predict divergence.
