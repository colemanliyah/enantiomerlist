# Predicting Odor Divergence

The question we set out to answer was "can we predict odor divergence of enantiomers?"

In other words, can we predict the magnitude difference of odor within an enantiomeric pair? 

Predicting odor divergence will not tell us which molecule in the pair smells stronger, it will merely tell us how different the molcules in a pair are precieved.
