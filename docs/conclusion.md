# Conclusion

With this new approach we were able to capture approximately 40% of the varience using strucutral alone.

As documented in the notebook, we attempted to use PCA with VCD and 3rd party embeddings as features to the model to improve performance. Niehter approach was better at capturing varience than the structural model.
